# this file contains utility procs, which are used all over
# the higl-level bindings of this library. They are mostly related
# to convenience procs, which are missing from the Nim standard
# library, e.g. to get the shape of a nested sequence.
# Others are more specific, but still not restricted to the H5
# library, e.g. formatName(), which formats a string handed to
# the `[]`(H5File) proc to a format suitable for parsing.
# read: any proc, whose understanding does not require knowledge
# of the H5 library (although the purpose of the function might)
# and does not make use of any datatypes defined for H5 interop.
