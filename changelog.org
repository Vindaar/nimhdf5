* v0.3.13
- =visit_file= now does not open all groups and datasets anymore. Only
  recognizes which groups / files actually exist
- adds =close= for dataset / groups. Both are now aware if they are
  open or not
- add a string conversion for =H5Attr=
- fix accessing a dataset from a group. Now uses the path of the group
  as the base
- fix error message in =read_hyperslab_vlen=
- turn some templates into procs
- make =blosc= an optional import
* v0.3.12
- =H5File= as a proc is deprecated and replaced by =H5open=!
- reading of string attributes now takes care to check if they are
  variable length or fixed length strings
- import of =blosc= plugin is not automatic anymore, but needs to be
  done manually by compiling with =-d:blosc= 
- remove a lot old comments and imports from days past...
* v0.3.11
- change usage of =csize= to =csize_t= in full wrapper / library. For
  most use cases this did not have any effect (=csize= was an int,
  instead of unsigned). But for =H5T_VARIABLE = csize.high= this
  caused problems, because the value was not the one expected
  (=csize_t.high=)
- add support for compound datatypes. Creating a dataset / writing and
  reading data works for any objects `T` which have fields that can be
  stored in HDF5 files currently. 
  Objects and tuples are treated the same!
- add support for =seq[string]= attributes
- reorder =datasets.nim= and clean up =[]= logic
- add =[]= accessor from a =H5Group=
- add =isVlen= helper to check if dataset is variable length
- make =special_type= usage optional when reading datasets
- fix branching in =nimToH5type= to be fully compile time
- add =H5File= to replace =H5FileObj= (latter is kept as deprecated
  typedef)
- variable lenght data is created automatically if user gives =seq[T]=
  type in =create_dataset=
- =read= can automatically read variable length data if =seq[T]=
  datatype is given
- add tests for compound data and =seq[string]= attributes
* v0.3.10
- change =dtypeAnyKind= definition when creating dataset
- improve iteration over subgroups / datasets
* v0.3.9
- fix mapping of H5 types to Nim types, see PR #36.

* v0.3.8

- remove dependency of =typetraits= and =typeinfo= modules by
  introducing custom =DtypeKind enum=
