* v0.3.11
- change usage of =csize= to =csize_t= in full wrapper / library. For
  most use cases this did not have any effect (=csize= was an int,
  instead of unsigned). But for =H5T_VARIABLE = csize.high= this
  caused problems, because the value was not the one expected
  (=csize_t.high=)
- add support for =seq[string]= attributes
- reorder =datasets.nim= and clean up =[]= logic
- add =[]= accessor from a =H5Group=
- add =isVlen= helper to check if dataset is variable length
- make =special_type= usage optional when reading datasets
* v0.3.10
- change =dtypeAnyKind= definition when creating dataset
- improve iteration over subgroups / datasets
* v0.3.9
- fix mapping of H5 types to Nim types, see PR #36.

* v0.3.8

- remove dependency of =typetraits= and =typeinfo= modules by
  introducing custom =DtypeKind enum=
